    <h2>Musical Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      Two hobbies I would love to pick up are playing the guitar and learning
      music. Itâ€™s been a goal of mine since I was little to be able to read
      music. To me, learning to read musical notes seems difficult , maybe
      because it takes so much discipline!
    </p>
    <p>
      Never really learned how to play music well growing up, but still know I
      could do it! Guitar would be my first choice because of how many different
      strumming patterns someone can play. Also, the different genres that can
      include a guitar is limitless.
